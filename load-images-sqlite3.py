# This module will create the product_images table in the database and load it with the images. The script is
# designed to run in this folder and find the images in the sub-folders "images-large-by-product-id" and
# "images-small-by-product-id".
#
# The product_images table primary key is constructed from the product_id (foreign to the products table) and
# the type of image, small or large.
